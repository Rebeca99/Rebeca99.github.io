  Loss-of-function ZDHHC9 variants are associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), rolandic epilepsy (RE) and developmental language difficulties. This study integrates human neurophysiological data with a computational model to identify a potential neural mechanism explaining ZDHHC9-associated differences in cortical function and cognition
